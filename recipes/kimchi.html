    <h2>Kimchi</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe that I'm looking forward to making sometime in the future</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>napa cabbage</li>
        <li>course sea salt</li>   
        <li>fish sauce</li>   
        <li>green onions</li>   
        <li>small white onion</li>

    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut cabbages in half lengthwise and trim the ends. Rinse and cut into pieces about 2 inch square. Place cabbage into large resealable bags; sprinkle salt evenly over leaves to coat. Use your hands to rub salt into cabbage. Seal the bags and leave at room temperature for 6 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rinse cabbage leaves under cold water, at least 2 to 3 times, to remove most of the salt; drain and squeeze out any excess liquid.
        </li>   
        <li>
            Place rinsed cabbage in a large container with a tight fitting lid. Stir in fish sauce, green onions, white onion, garlic, sugar, and ginger. Sprinkle Korean chile powder over mixture.; wear plastic gloves to protect your hands and rub chile powder into cabbage leaves until evenly coated.
        </li>   
        <li>
            Seal the container and set in a cool dry place. Leave undisturbed for 4 days. Refrigerate before serving, and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 month (if it lasts that long!). 
        </li>
    </ol>
